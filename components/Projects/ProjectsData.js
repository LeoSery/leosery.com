    Description: "Game made during my bachelor 3 year (2022/2023) for a Unity3D module at Ynov Bordeaux. You play as a character who can use the ingredients at his disposal to make the recipes that arrive. You need to get the vegetables from a vending machine and then cut them. Then if the vegetable can be cooked, you need to put it in a pan and then put the pan on the stovetop to cook the ingredient. Once your ingredient is cooked, you can put it on a plate, so you can combine it with other foods. Once your plate contains all the ingredients called for in the recipe, you can take the dish to the delivery counter.",

The goal of the project was to create an application that could be controlled from an STM32 programmable card. So I decided to make a Pong game, controllable with 2 joysticks. on the card a script written in C makes it possible to recover the values returned by the joysticks and the game is made under Unity3D with C# which reads the values of the joysticks to move the paddles",
